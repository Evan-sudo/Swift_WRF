## ‚ö°Ô∏è**Overview**

![Overview of SwiftWRF.](./img/a.png)

We propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under
single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated rasterization to render spectra at over 100k FPS and uses the
lightweight MLP to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel
spectrum synthesis, the efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal
strength indicator (RSSI) prediction.

## ‚ùì**Requirements**

Before running the code, install the required dependencies:

```
cd gsplat
pip install .[dev]
cd ../
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `gsplat` module is implemented based on [GaussianImage](https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/GaussianImage). Please ensure it is correctly installed before proceeding.

## üìñ**Dataset**
Before running the experiments, you need to download the **NeRF2-s23** and **Our customized** datasets.  

- **NeRF2-s23**: See [NeRF2](https://github.com/XPengZhao/NeRF2?tab=readme-ov-file)
- **Our customized data**: [SwiftWRF](https://1drv.ms/f/c/b1b302e6d09c4153/EpCJ4-YrQjZGgOMjYdWOFTQBQ9tqdCVqmRm-s7iU0mZkJA?e=iLQE6W)


The SwiftWRF dataset comprises three indoor scenes: bedroom, conference, and office; each captured under either a TX-moving or RX-moving setting. Each scene includes approximately 6,000 spectra, and the dataset is organized following the structure of NeRF2.

After downloading, place the dataset inside the `datasets/` directory, e.g., datasets/NeRF2, before proceeding with training or evaluation.

## üèÉ**Startup**
To run **SwiftWRF**, execute the following command:

```
./scripts/train.sh <yourpath>/datasets/nerf2
```

To run **SwiftWRF** with loaded models, add the following command to ./scripts/train.sh:

```
--model_path "./checkpoints/"
```
## ‚ùï**TODO**
-Release training code for RSSI prediction.
